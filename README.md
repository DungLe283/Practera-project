# Practera Project – NSW Jobs Connect Industry Experience Program

This project was conducted under the **NSW Jobs Connect Industry Experience Program**, powered by **Practera**, in **June 2024**. I participated as the **Business Analyst Lead**, working with a team of 6 other members, and collaborated with a real industry client, **EDU Talent**, over a 2–3 week engagement.

The project aimed to address genuine business needs and improve **marketing and sales strategies** by:
- Identifying potential new or underserved customer segments.
- Providing **actionable recommendations** to enhance business performance.
